Small experiments with building small request-response handlers with Kotlin scripting. Super unfinished, not in any way safe, unsupported and with only questionable usefulness.

Put on your adventurer hat, all expeditions happen at your own risk ☢️

To try:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/service/reverser \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
	"textToReverse": "yellow"
}'
```
